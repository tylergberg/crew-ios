# Session Persistence Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to address session persistence issues in the FinalSend iOS app. The improvements focus on better error handling, session validation, and debugging capabilities.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Session Restoration Problems
- **Problem**: App would lose authentication state after being idle, requiring sign out/in
- **Root Cause**: Session validation logic was too strict and cleared valid sessions on network errors
- **Solution**: Improved session restoration with better error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 2. Token Refresh Issues
- **Problem**: Token refresh events weren't properly handled
- **Root Cause**: Limited error handling in token refresh scenarios
- **Solution**: Enhanced token refresh handling with automatic persistence

### 3. Session State Synchronization
- **Problem**: Supabase client state and Keychain storage could get out of sync
- **Root Cause**: No validation of stored sessions against current client state
- **Solution**: Added session validation and state synchronization

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Session Restoration Logic

```swift
func restoreSessionOnLaunch() async {
    // Check for expired sessions before validation
    if let expiresAt = storedSession.expiresAt, now > expiresAt {
        // Clear expired session immediately
        try KeychainStore.delete(.supabaseSessionJSON)
        return
    }
    
    // Try Supabase client first, fallback to stored session
    do {
        let currentSession = try await client.auth.session
        // Use current session from client
    } catch {
        // Fallback to stored session with validation
        self.currentSession = storedSession
        await loadUserProfile() // Validate via API call
    }
}
```

### 2. Better Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Don't immediately clear sessions on network failures
- **Session Validation**: Use API calls to validate session validity
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms when primary validation fails

### 3. Comprehensive Logging

Added detailed logging throughout the authentication flow:
- Session restoration steps
- Token refresh events
- Error conditions
- State changes

### 4. Debug Tools

Created comprehensive debugging tools accessible through:
- Profile view (Debug builds only)
- Notification settings (Debug builds only)

## Debug Tools Usage

### Accessing Debug Tools

1. **From Profile View**:
   - Tap your profile picture in the dashboard
   - Scroll to "Debug Tools" section (debug builds only)
   - Tap "Session Debug"

2. **From Notification Settings**:
   - Go to Profile ‚Üí Notification Settings
   - Scroll to "Debug Tools" section (debug builds only)
   - Tap "Open Debug Tools"

### Available Debug Actions

#### Session Management
- **Login Status**: Shows current authentication state
- **Bootstrapped**: Shows if app has completed initial auth check
- **User Email/ID**: Shows current user information

#### Session Actions
- **Refresh Session**: Manually refresh the current session
- **Validate Session**: Test if current session is valid via API call
- **Debug Session State**: Print detailed session info to console
- **Force Re-authentication**: Clear session and force re-login

#### Notification Settings
- **Authorization Status**: Shows notification permission status
- **Device Token**: Shows APNs device token
- **Test Notifications**: Send test local notifications

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: App shows logged out after being idle
**Symptoms**: App appears to lose authentication, nothing loads
**Debug Steps**:
1. Open Debug Tools
2. Check "Login Status" - should show "‚úÖ Logged In"
3. If not logged in, check console for session restoration logs
4. Try "Refresh Session" button
5. If that fails, try "Validate Session" to test API connectivity

#### Issue: Session validation fails
**Symptoms**: App shows logged in but API calls fail
**Debug Steps**:
1. Use "Debug Session State" to check session details
2. Check if session is expired in console output
3. Try "Refresh Session" to get new tokens
4. If persistent, use "Force Re-authentication"

#### Issue: Profile not loading
**Symptoms**: User info doesn't appear, profile picture missing
**Debug Steps**:
1. Check if session is valid with "Validate Session"
2. Verify user ID is present in debug info
3. Check console for profile loading errors
4. Try "Refresh Session" to reload profile data

### Console Logging

The improved system provides detailed console logging with emojis for easy identification:

```
üîÑ Starting session restoration...
üì¶ Found stored session for user: user@example.com
‚úÖ Supabase client has valid session
üíæ Session persisted to Keychain
üë§ Loading user profile...
‚úÖ User profile loaded: John Doe
üèÅ Session restoration completed. isLoggedIn: true
```

**Log Levels**:
- üîÑ Process starting
- ‚úÖ Success
- ‚ùå Error
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
- üì¶ Data found/loaded
- üíæ Data saved
- üë§ User-related operations
- üèÅ Process completed

## Testing the Improvements

### Manual Testing

1. **Session Persistence Test**:
   - Log in to the app
   - Background the app for 30+ minutes
   - Return to app
   - Verify you're still logged in

2. **Network Recovery Test**:
   - Log in to the app
   - Turn off network connectivity
   - Background and return to app
   - Turn network back on
   - Verify session is restored

3. **Token Refresh Test**:
   - Log in to the app
   - Wait for token refresh (or use debug tools)
   - Verify session remains valid

### Automated Testing

Run the test suite to verify improvements:

```bash
# Run auth persistence tests
xcodebuild test -scheme finalsend -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:finalsendTests/AuthPersistenceTests
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Automatic Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for failed API calls
2. **Offline Support**: Handle offline scenarios more gracefully
3. **Session Analytics**: Track session duration and refresh patterns
4. **Biometric Authentication**: Add Face ID/Touch ID for app unlock

### Monitoring

Consider implementing:
- Session duration tracking
- Authentication failure analytics
- User experience metrics
- Performance monitoring for auth operations

## Support

If you continue to experience session persistence issues:

1. **Collect Debug Info**: Use the debug tools to gather session state
2. **Check Console Logs**: Look for authentication-related log messages
3. **Test Network**: Verify network connectivity and API access
4. **Clear and Retry**: Use "Force Re-authentication" as a last resort

The improved system should significantly reduce session persistence issues and provide better tools for troubleshooting when they do occur.
